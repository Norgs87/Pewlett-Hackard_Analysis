# Pewlett-Hackard_Analysis
## Overview
### The purpose of this project is to determine the number of retiring employees per their title.  For the second part of the project we then determined employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program.
## Results
### One thing that I noticed looking through the tables was that the position that has the most employees retiring is Senior Engineer.  Another thing that I noticed is while 2 managers are on the retiring list, none are on the mentorship elegibility list. The retiring engineers (Senior Engineer, Engineer, Asst. Engineer) tolated 36,291 for 50.01% of the total retiring employees.  One last thing that I noticed was that 70% of the retiring employees have senior in their title. 
## Summary
### Looking at the retiring titles tables concerning the silver tsunami question, around 70,000 employees have been determined to be potentially retiring. The majority of the retiring employees are mostly high ranking as seen in the below table.

## Concerning backfilling the positions through the mentorship program, only around 1500 employees have been tagged for mentorship which doesn't come close to the 70,000 retiring.
